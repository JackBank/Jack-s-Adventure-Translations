*DO NOT CHANGE THIS*
=============================
Translation to "Jack's Adventure"

Remember:
Do not change anything like \n[?] (? is a number)
Remember not to use precise translations. Make it sound good! :)
Always write in-between " " and not where it says what you have to translate
note that some lines go down to an extra line (ex: line 15 and 16) there you have to cut it
good like that

You will also see lines like "LV" they are usually under what it's shorted from.
EX: "LV" is shorted from "Level"


Language: 
Translated by:

You'll see stuff like "0 out of 20 done" here you will fill out the
"0" with the number of finished lines you have done. This helps
me and you to find out if you have not finished some lines or
if there have been added new ones.

[Actors] 0 out of 10 lines finished
Please do not mind the names. They are there so I know what actor they are for
But translate the nicknames :)

NOTE: Some of these nicknames may be hard to translate
into making any sense. If you can't figure out
anything to translate into just think about
something that sounds familiar.
It needs to match the actor's class.
If you want to know the class of the actor ask me please :)
